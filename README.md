modem-heath-check
=================

Preforms some basic heath checks and restarts a modem as needed if it seems to not be passing traffic.
This requires you to have the webui on your modem enabled and you will need to change the curl command to work with the restart page of your modem.

This was designed to work with cable modems, but I suppose this could work for other devices as well.
